# JS-Quiz
This assignment was incredibly difficult. I tried my best, I really hope I get to come back and work on this further. I am contempt with what I was able to do giving it my best.

# How to run JS-Quiz
Start on start.html. From there run the site and begin answering the questions. I will come back and add a way to end once there's no more quesitons to populate/paginate.
